# hello-world
In order for you to effectively interact with Spanish-speaking collaborators, you might want to consider me to translate back and forth. One way to do this is via documents. However, in order to preserve all your passionate remarks, I recommend holding Video or Audio Conferences where I can provide instant simultaneous translation.
I am Mexican by birth but actually look from anywhere else but Mexico. Lived in New York for seven years working as an Adman. In that capacity, I also worked before and after NY in multinational corporations. Learned English when I was a little boy from Grandpa. Forced by circumstances, I relocated to SLP Mexico where I currently live. Here, I have helped out professionals and academics dialogue across cultural barriers by assisting them with Translation. So that's what I do. Mostly.
